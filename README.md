    How long would it take me to earn the amount of money I am spending right now?

Affordable updates the prices on e-commerce websites to include how long it will take you to earn back the amount.

Improve your spending habits by taking into account the **time it will take you to earn the amount** you are spending currently.

## File Structure
- The Chrome Extension source code resides in [src/](https://github.com/me-heer/affordable/tree/1.0.0/src)
- To have some basic end-to-end tests using puppeteer, the extension code folder is wrapped inside a npm project (which is present at the root of the repository).
